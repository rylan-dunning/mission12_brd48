Hello TA, sorry to make you do some extra stuff but since my file was too big to upload, I had to zip it, and the only way I could upload it was through a tag. on the left you'll see a tag, called 'tag'. That has the zip for my mission 12. If you would rather just me show it to you if it doesn't work, just let me know. I promise I will not edit it. Let me know if you have questions, and please have mercy on this unconventional turning in method
